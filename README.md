# 3rd Party Managed IB

This project is designed to manage third-party integrations with Iceberg. It includes configurations and tools to streamline the process.

## Configuration

The project requires a `config.ini` file for setup. Below is an example of the `config.ini` file:

```ini
[E2DEMO]
CATALOG_TYPE = UC
CATALOG_NAMESPACE = mycatalog
CATALOG_URL = myworkspace.cloud.databricks.com
CATALOG_CREDENTIAL = xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Place the `config.ini` file in the root directory of the project.
